#todos
#1 what do we do if snyk fails? an artifact has already been publihsed?
#2 need to parameterize repo and semver
#3 need to clarify the build tags we want
#4 need to clarify how use gets notified if synk encounters an error; does it just keep on going? or does it stop?
#5 STRETCH objective : integrate SBOM
#6 where are we sending the snyk/trivy reports? Thinking about sending it to its OWN file in artifactory named: sha-digest.snky ; need to look at how the     - name: Publish Helm charts uploads and modify?

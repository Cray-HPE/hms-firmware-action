## Warning

**WARNING:** Non-compute nodes (NCNs) should be locked with the HSM locking API to ensure they are not unintentionally updated by FAS. Research "*NCN and Management Node Locking*" for more information. [ANIEUWSMA-LINK?]  Failure to lock the NCNs could result in unintentional update of the NCNs if FAS is not used correctly; this will lead to system instability problems.
